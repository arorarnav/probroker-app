"""
The automated worker. Runs on a schedule (via GitHub Actions -- see
.github/workflows/worker.yml). Each run:

  1. Asks Supabase for every report with status = 'processing'
  2. For each one: downloads the uploaded chat file, runs it through the
     pipeline (parse -> extract -> match -> report), uploads the finished
     .xlsx back to Supabase, and marks that exact row 'completed'
  3. If anything goes wrong for a given report, marks it 'failed' instead
     of leaving it stuck silently -- so it's visible, not lost

Because every report row already has the correct user_id attached to it
from the moment payment happened, there is no separate "who does this go
to" step -- the customer's own dashboard already only shows their own
rows (Row Level Security), so writing the finished file back to the same
row is the entire delivery mechanism.
